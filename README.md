#### Description: A portfolio to showcase my works in a creative way.

I am currently developing a number of games and creative works using amazing (and free!) online tools such as Unity, Blender, Gravity Sketch, and Roblox.
I'm fairly new in the computer science and game development industry, though I always love finding a new challenge to embark on.


#### FILES:
* INDEX.HTML
  - This is what the user will see when viewing the website. 
  - Equip with a navigation bar for easy maneuverability within the site.
  - The next section, or "page content" of the site was particularly difficult to structure from a scalability standpoint. The end goal was to have the user not think about how to restructure HTML just to add another item to their page; hence why most of the content creation gets handled on the JS side of the web-app.
* MAIN.JS
  - Yes, this is pure, unrefined JavaScript without any frameworks or libraries. It may have not been the most elegant solution, but it made me happy to be able to learn how to do this by hand.
  - Upon viewing the file, you may see that I am simulating a JSON response (from firebase or any other data-storing framework) in hopes of eventually transferring my project into firebase for a more dynamic experience.
  - The rest of the file is just me trying to dynamically generate HTML for each of the specific attributes of the JSON objects.
* STYLES.CSS
  - This is where the real magic happens.
  - Anything that looks nice from the website is coming from this file. It really is the icing on the cake in terms of websites.
  - One of the new features of css I explored in this project was css keyframes. It allows me to make responsive and engaging content for the user without having to dive into hundreds of liens fo javascript.
